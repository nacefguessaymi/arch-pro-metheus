#Matebook X Pro Arch Install

In 2019 I bought a [Matebook X Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei_MateBook_X_Pro).
This was a pretty good system, however, after all the years, this computer became really slow due to a bloated windows instance.
It became pretty much unusable, with about a 5 minute boot time, and almost 30 minutes startup time (time that it takes to actually start using the system).
This became very frustrating to deal with and I migrated to a new laptop (Macbook Pro). 
As a fun personal project, I decided to install Arch Linux on this laptop to see if it would fix these issues and revive this laptop.
In addition, the battery life was very short, so I will probably work on replacing it.
The thermals on this laptop are very high as well, and I think I will follow [this nice guide](https://bradshacks.com/matebook-x-pro-throttling/) on improving thermals.
Finally, the screen is cracked on this laptop (with no actual problems other than random touches), so I have to replace the screen.

This document serves as a guide for myself and others if they choose to follow, on my process for getting this laptop running like new in 2025.
